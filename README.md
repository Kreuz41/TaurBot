# TaurBot Project ü§ñ

## Description üìã

This repository contains two projects aimed at creating and managing an investment portfolio, as well as interacting with users via a Telegram bot.

## Projects:

- **taur-bot-api**: This is an ASP.NET Core API designed for managing an investment portfolio. It uses the MVC architectural pattern, dependency injection (DI), singletons, and the repository pattern to handle portfolio data.

- **taur-bot**: This is a bot that communicates with the InvestmentAPI to interact with users. The bot is built using the Telegram.Bot library to provide a smooth user experience.

- **ethapi**: This API is specifically designed for cryptocurrency operations.

All projects run in containers and are orchestrated via Docker Compose.
